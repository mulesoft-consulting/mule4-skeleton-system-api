# mule4-skeleton-system-api
This is a Mule 4.1 example of an API using API Management that can be used as a starting point for building system APIs in Mule 4.1. 

Note, the scope features of minimal-logging are not displayed correctly by Studio 7.1 or 7.2. Support for displaying SDK connector scopes is expected in Studio 7.3.

## Uses

The project contains examples using:

* The minimal-logging connector, 
* The secure property connector (formally called the secure-property-placeholder),
* Maven deployment using the mule-maven-plugin descriptor,
* Api Manager gateway auto-discovery registration,
* Using the Maven filter "feature" to add Maven properties to code in files stored in the resources-filtered directory...specifically, updating the api.base and log4j2 configurations with the project name.

## Purpose

This project is an example that can be deployed and will run when properly configured. However, the main usage for this is a starting point for building new APIs.
Developers of an API can copy this project to get all the "boilerplate" elements for an API project. Then begin adding and modifying these elements to create the new API. 

### Configuration Properties

The configuration properties are stored in the src/main/resources-filtered/mule4-skeleton-proxy-${mule.env}.yaml file:

* api.id contains the Api Manager instance's autodiscovery api id,
* api.base is the base uri for the API, the default is the project name taken from the pom file,
* api.port is the port number of the Api's HTTP listener,
* my.client-id is the client id this API uses to call other APIs
* my.client-secret is the client secret registered for this API to use for calling other APIs

Note that the api.port is not used if a shared domain is configured and used for the HTTP listener configuration.


## Runtime properties

The properties mule.env and mule.key need to be set in the Mule runtime in order for the property configurations to be located. Additionally, if the Mule runtime is not configured to connect to API Manager, the API will be disabled (by default).

For Studio, add the following VM command line values when running the API:

 -Danypoint.platform.gatekeeper=disabled -Dmule.env=local -Dmule.key=Mulesoft12345678

## Maven Settingss

The Mule deployment assumes that certain deployment properties will come from profiles specified when the mvn command is executed. An example-settings.xml is provided as a reference
for creating your own settings.xml file. This is a standard feature of Maven and is described in its online documentation. Once the settings.xml file has been created, export a u and a p shell environment variables containing your Anypoint user name and password. Then use this maven command to deploy the API project:

```
mvn clean install deploy -Denv=xxx -DmuleDeploy
```
Replacing the xxx's with the appropriate values.
